        <p class="project-paragraph">hello there, welcome to my project page.
            these are some of the work i did before joining Zuri.
            you may not have the time to read this, as am aware that there are 
            so many work you have to look at. 
            but this particular project is dear to me. its a static page, and u may find 
            a lot of errors, but this project is very personal to me, because
            it is where i pushed myself a little.
            after this, i tried other projects none are interactive though and i hope u find interesting.

        <p class="slack">
            this project helped me to understand css better.. it took me four 
            days to work on this. this particular project makes me laugh because i 
            kept trying make it look exactly like the slack page. 
            feed your eyes and maybe laugh a little.
            THAT's WHY I HAVE YOU, TO TEACH ME HOW TO DO IT BETTER.

        <p class="tesla">this is one project i enjoyed working on.
            But at the time of this project, i started feeling it was time i start learning javscrpt
            or React. i wanted these projecst to be very interactive.
